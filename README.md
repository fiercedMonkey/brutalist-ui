## About Brutalist Design

Brutalism is a design movement that emerged in the mid-20th century, characterized by its raw, rugged, and often austere aesthetic. It embraces simplicity, functionality, and an honesty of materials, creating designs that are both provocative and utilitarian. Brutalism stands in stark contrast to the polished, sleek, and highly stylized interfaces that dominate the digital landscape today.

## Features

- A collection of UI components inspired by Brutalist design principles.
- Built using modern technologies including Vite, Vitest, React, Storybook, and Sass for a seamless development experience.
- Highly customizable, allowing you to tailor the components to your specific project needs.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples to help you get started quickly.
